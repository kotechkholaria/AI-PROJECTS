    "Every year the lives of approximately 1.35 million people are cut short as a result of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury.\n",
    "\n",
    "Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.\n",

    "The objective of this project is to use the dataset on car accidents on Seattle,USAto explore the incident severityand to build a machine learning algorithm to predict the future accident severity to minimize the chance for car collisions which will predict the severity of an accident in a current weather and visibility conditions. when conditions are bad it should give us a notification to be more careful When conditions are bad, this model will alert drivers to remind them to be more careful.\n"

    "the data source is provided by Coursera for the same purpose. The dataset contains 37 different columns, a few redundant and a few not very impactful. So the first step after acquiring data was to process the data. Following columns were selected for the project: 'SEVERITYCODE', 'ADDRTYPE', 'INTKEY', 'COLLISIONTYPE', 'PERSONCOUNT', 'PEDCOUNT', 'PEDCYLCOUNT', 'VEHCOUNT', 'JUNCTIONTYPE', 'INATTENTIONIND', 'UNDERINFL', 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND', 'LIGHTCOND', 'SPEEDING', 'HITPARKEDCAR' . All these selected columns then were converted to usable format by one-hot coding or converting categorical data into processable integer values to ease out the execution of problem. \n",
